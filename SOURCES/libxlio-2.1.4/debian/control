Package: libxlio
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: LD_PRELOAD-able library that boosts performance
 libxlio is a LD_PRELOAD-able library that boosts performance of TCP and
 UDP traffic. It allows application written over standard socket API to
 handle fast path data traffic from user space over Ethernet and/or
 Infiniband with full network stack bypass and get better throughput,
 latency and packets/sec rate.
 .
 No application binary change is required for that.
 library is supported by RDMA capable devices that support "verbs"
 IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET QP for Ethernet and/or IBV_QPT_UD QP for IPoIB.
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library itself.

 .
 This package includes headers for building programs with libxlio's interface
 directly, as opposed to loading it dynamically with LD_PRELOAD.
