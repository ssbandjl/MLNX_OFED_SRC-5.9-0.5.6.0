XLIO Testing Environment
=======================

This set of tests is based on Google Test C++ environment 
https://github.com/google/googletest

Testing XLIO Extended API
------------------------
1. Enable EXTRA_API_ENABLED in tests/gtest/xlio/xlio_base.cc
2. Compile the gtests by issuing from root directory:
   make -C tests/gtest
3. Launch tests by issuing:
   LD_PRELOAD=<path>/libxlio.so tests/gtest/gtest --addr=client_ip,server_ip

Testing Environment
-------------------
The XLIO Extended API gtest environment requires that there be two interfaces
connected back to back or via a switch. One is the server and the other is the
client.
